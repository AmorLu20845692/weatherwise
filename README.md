# WeatherWise - Intelligent Weather Analysis & Advisory System

WeatherWise is a comprehensive Python application that combines real-time weather data retrieval, interactive visualizations, and natural language processing to provide users with intelligent weather analysis and recommendations.

## Features

### Weather Data Retrieval
- Real-time weather data for any global location
- 5-day forecast with hourly detail
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Uses wttr.in API (no API key required)

### Interactive Visualizations
- **Temperature Trends**: Multi-line charts showing daily temperature ranges
- **Precipitation Forecast**: Dual-chart approach with daily totals and hourly timing
- Professional styling with contextual information

### Natural Language Interface
- Ask weather questions in plain English
- Intelligent parsing of location, time, and weather attributes
- Conversational responses with helpful advice

### User Experience
- Intuitive menu-driven interface
- Multi-location weather comparison
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Input validation and user guidance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install requests matplotlib pyinputplus
```

### Running the Application
1. Open `starter_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells to load the application
3. Execute the main application cell to start WeatherWise
4. Follow the interactive menu prompts

### Usage Examples
- **Basic Weather**: "What's the weather like in London?"
- **Specific Queries**: "Will it rain tomorrow in Tokyo?"
- **Planning**: "How hot will it be in Sydney this week?"

## Project Structure

- `starter_notebook.ipynb` — Complete WeatherWise application
- `PROMPTING.md` — Development process documentation
- `ai-conversations/` — Development interaction logs (5 conversations)
- `submission/reflection.md` — Project development reflection
- `ASSIGNMENT.md` — Original assignment specification

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **Weather Data Module**: API integration with comprehensive error handling
- **Visualization Engine**: Matplotlib-based charts with professional styling
- **NLP Parser**: Pattern matching for natural language understanding
- **UI Framework**: pyinputplus-based menu system with validation

### Design Patterns
- Modular function design with single responsibilities
- Consistent error handling across all components
- User-centered interface design with progressive disclosure
- Robust input validation and sanitization
